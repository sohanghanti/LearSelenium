forced wait:
    import time

        time.sleep(seconds)


 by default webdriver waits for the page to be loaded for 30 secs.
 we can also set page load timeout to anything, by default the page load timeout is set to 30secs by the webdriver
 the code driver.set_page_load_timeout(1)   will override the timeout of 30 secs and will set to 1 second

 driver.Chrome()
 driver.maximise_window()
 driver.set_page_load_timeout(1)
 driver.get(url)

 here, driver.set_page_load_timeout(1) would wait for 1 second to get the page loaded after url is browsed.

 implicit wait:

    it checks the existence of the element
 we get NoSuchElement exception.
 reason could be:
 when webdriver is searching for any element, it may happen that the page is not loaded completely
 webdriver is not able to get that element.
 we can instruct the webdriver to wait for a certain time for the web element to get loaded,
 and set the test to fail if webdriver is not able to find in the given time

 it is applicable for all the web elements once it is set to driver in setup method

explicit wait:
    it checks on property of the element:
        e.g. check element is enabled/disabled, wait till text present etc.
